            <h2>Welcome to Anxout</h2>
            <p>Anxout is a project that I started working in 2022, due to some things
                that happened in my life that year.<br>The main objective and purpose is to help people that usually suffer from anxiety, depression or <br>any mental issue, to talk to someone and make helping
                connections.<br>Basically it's a place where you can be yourself without feeling judged.<br><br><strong>Who am I?</strong>
                <br> Well, it doesn't really matter, for now.</p>
