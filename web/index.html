            <h2>Welcome to Anxout</h2>
            <p>Anxout is a project/community that I thought about and start working on it in 2022, due to some things
                that happened in my life that year.<br>The main objective and purpouse is to help people (specially
                people that suffer
                from anxiety, depression or any mental issue), to talk to someone or make friends.<br>Basically it's a
                place where you can be yourself without feeling judged.<br><strong>Who am I?</strong> Well, it doesn't really matter, for
                now.</p>
